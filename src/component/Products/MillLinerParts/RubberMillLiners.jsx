              When it comes to rubber mill liners, Nanjing Durga Alloys had
              focused to cast this material for our customers. We cooperation
              with our friend foundries to supply high-quality polyurethane
              rubber mill liners.

              The polyurethane is a polymer composed of organic units joined by
              carbamate (urethane) links. While most polyurethanes are
              thermosetting polymers that do not melt when heated, thermoplastic
              polyurethanes are also available. Polyurethane polymers are
              traditionally and most commonly formed by reacting a diisocyanate
              with a polyol. Since polyurethanes contain two types of monomers,
              which polymerize one after the other, they are classed as
              alternating copolymers. Both the isocyanates and polyols used to
              make polyurethanes contain, on average, two or more functional
              groups per molecule.

              Qiming Mill Liner offers a complete polyurethane mill liner
              solution including lifter bars, plates, and grates. Alloys and
              profiles are selected based on your specific application and
              operating conditions. Different lining materials such as rubber,
              metallic and polyurethane mill liners can be combined in the same
              mill to achieve optimal performance. Design and material selection
              is executed using High Fidelity Simulation (HFS) and experience
              from thousands of real-world cases. Qiming Mill Liners invented
              the polyurethane mill liners concept over 30 years ago, and our
              linings are still the world’s most widely used today. The reason
              is simple, we offer our customers solutions that improve grinding
              efficiency and lead to increased profitability.

              <ul>
                <li>
                  Polyurethane rubber mill liners’s working life 5-10 times than
                  normal metal mill liners in some work conditions;
                </li>
                <li>
                  Polyurethane rubber mill liners weight less than metal mill
                  liners, which easy to carry
                </li>
                <li>
                  Because the no-load load is reduced, the power saving effect
                  is obvious. Under the normal load condition, the new
                  polyurethane liner can save 15% -30% of power
                </li>
                <li>15% reduction in ball mill media consumption</li>

                <li>Ball mill working noise is greatly reduced</li>

              Durga Alloys® premium manganese steel that has been developed from
              the original Hadfield’s manganese steel specification, our
              variation can provide unequaled toughness with excellent
              resistance to abrasion, which improves as the steelwork hardens in
              operation. Available in our M14, M18, and M21 material grades we
              have a cost-effective solution to your specific requirements.

              On the other hand, Durga Alloys’s engineers have researched some
              patent material to improve crusher wear parts span life. Such as,
              TIC inserts wear parts in crushing hard stone (1.5-3 times than
              manganese steel); Mircoalloy steel wear parts in crushing copper
              mine(1.5-2 times than manganese steel); Alloy steel wear parts in
              mineral separation…
