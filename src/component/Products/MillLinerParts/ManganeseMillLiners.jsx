            <h4>Manganese Mill Liners By Durga Alloys</h4>
            <p>
              Manganese steel is a kind of material for When it comes to
              manganese mill liners, Durga Alloys is one of the largest
              austenitic manganese steel cast foundries in China. With over 20
              years of cast technology, Our austenitic manganese steel mill
              liners span life more than other foundries.
            </p>
            <p>
              The hardness of manganese steel in the solution annealed and water
              quenched condition is normally around 220 HB. It is possible to
              strain to harden this material to approximately 500 HB. In order
              to achieve this high hardness level, the impact loading must be
              high while the material wearing away from gouging abrasion is
              limited. It is typical in crushing applications where the main
              wear mechanism is gouging abrasion that the manganese steel will
              harden to some intermediate level, typically 350-450 HB
            </p>

            <p>
              This material used for grid liners, and generally smaller mills.
              Its great advantage is that it works hardens under stress, yet the
              substrate remains tough and can withstand extreme impact without
              fracture. Its primary disadvantage is that it spreads with impact,
              so solid liners begin to squeeze together and become extremely
              difficult to remove, and can damage a mill shell if the stress is
              allowed to build up to an extreme level.

              Durga Alloys® premium manganese steel that has been developed from
              the original Hadfield’s manganese steel specification, our
              variation can provide unequaled toughness with excellent
              resistance to abrasion, which improves as the steelwork hardens in
              operation. Available in our M14, M18, and M21 material grades we
              have a cost-effective solution to your specific requirements.

              On the other hand, Durga Alloys’s engineers have researched some
              patent material to improve crusher wear parts span life. Such as,
              TIC inserts wear parts in crushing hard stone (1.5-3 times than
              manganese steel); Mircoalloy steel wear parts in crushing copper
              mine(1.5-2 times than manganese steel); Alloy steel wear parts in
              mineral separation…
