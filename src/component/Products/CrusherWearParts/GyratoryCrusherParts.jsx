            <h4>Gyratory Crusher Parts By Durga Alloys</h4>
            <p>
              When it comes to gyratory crusher parts, Durga Alloys had
              manufactured many kinds of gyratory crusher wear parts, which
              include liners, mantles, spider caps, and spider arms
            </p>
            <p>
              The Durga Alloys primary gyratory crusher parts have the most
              important role in rock size reduction in mine operations as the
              crushing process starts from a primary crusher. The highest
              possible wear life is combined with mechanical reliability through
              the component life cycle. As the production stops are very
              expensive for mine operations, the Durga Alloys manganese
              gyratory crusher wears are easy and quick to install.
            </p>

            <p>
              Manganese steel mantle wear parts are provided with different
              shapes, surface profiles, and steel grades. Alloy steel, TIC
              inserts, and manganese steel concave wear parts are designed for
              the hardest rock in surface and underground operations.
            </p>
            <h5><strong>Gyratory Mantle Designs</strong></h5>
            <p>
              Our many mantle designs range from smooth one-piece options to
              large, full-toothed, two-piece, or three-piece solutions. Teeth
              can be used at almost any level on mantles to improve nip. Our
              users report that teeth greatly reduce slippage, and improve both
              production and liner wear life.
            </p>
            <p>
              On the other hand, we had designed TIC inserts gyratory mantle for
              our customers. Based on this design, our TIC insert mantle span
              life can be 2-3 times than normal manganese gyratory mantle.
            </p>
            <h5><strong>Gyratory Concave Designs</strong></h5>
            <p>
              We use the hardest alloy that will withstand the impacts of a
              specific gyratory application. This depends on the compressive
              strength, toughness, and friability of the material being crushed.
            </p>
            <p>
              For example, crushing some tough materials demands work-hardening
              manganese steel. But the same liners used for an abrasive, friable
              ore may wear quickly because there are insufficient impacts to
              cause the surface to work harden.
            </p>
            <p>
              On the other hand, Durga Alloys also supplies high-quality
              crusher spare parts. Under our engineer’s hard work, our
              aftermarket replacement spare parts beyond OEM spare parts
              quality.

              Durga Alloys® premium manganese steel that has been developed from
              the original Hadfield’s manganese steel specification, our
              variation can provide unequaled toughness with excellent
              resistance to abrasion, which improves as the steelwork hardens in
              operation. Available in our M14, M18, and M21 material grades we
              have a cost-effective solution to your specific requirements.
            </p>
            <p>
              On the other hand, Durga Alloys’s engineers have researched some
              patent material to improve crusher wear parts span life. Such as,
              TIC inserts wear parts in crushing hard stone (1.5-3 times than
              manganese steel); Mircoalloy steel wear parts in crushing copper
              mine(1.5-2 times than manganese steel); Alloy steel wear parts in
              mineral separation…
            </p>
            <p>
