                  Shredder hammers are the main shredder wear parts, which
                  install in the rotor and direct to crush raw material. The
                  shredder hammers are manufactured by manganese steel, alloy
                  steel, and our patent TIC inserts steel.

                  Pin protectors protect the long pins that secure the hammers

                  weigh hundreds of pounds and are typically replaced after 5-10
                  hammer changes, or about every 1-2 weeks of operation.

                </h5>
                <p>
                  The shredder grates ensure that shredded metal does not leave
                  the shredding zone (hammermill) until shredded metal pieces
                  are reduced to the desired size. The characteristics of the
                  shredder grate’s openings are determined by shredded-metal
                  specifications and operating parameters. The shredder grates
                  sustain substantial abrasion and impacts from the rapidly
                  moving metal inside the hammermill.

                </h5>
                <p>
                  Breaker bars provide internal reinforcement against the impact
                  force of hammers on the metal being shredded. Anvils provide
                  an internal surface where feedstock material is introduced
                  into the hammermill and initially impacted by the hammers.
                  Breaker bars are often replaced at the same time as anvils and
                  grates.

                  Rotor and end disc caps protect the rotor from damage by the
                  metal being shredded in the hammermill. Depending on shredder
                  size, caps can weigh hundreds of pounds. Caps are replaced
                  after about 10-15 hammer replacements, or about every 2-3
                  weeks of operations.

                  Liners internally protect the shredder from damage by the
                  metal being shredded in the hammermill. Liners sustain
                  substantial abrasion and impacts from the rapidly moving metal
                  inside the hammermill. Depending on shredder size and material
                  being shredded, liners may need replacing after
                  100,000-200,000 tons of material have passed through the
                  shredder.
