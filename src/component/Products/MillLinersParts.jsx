            <h4>Mill Liners Durga Alloys</h4>
            <p>
              Mill liners are mainly used to protect the cylinder body from the
              direct impact and grinding of the grinding body and materials; at
              the same time, different forms of mill liner can also be used to
              adjust the movement state of the grinding body in each warehouse.
            </p>
            <p>
              When it comes to mill liners, Durga Alloys is one of the largest
              mill liners manufacturers in China. Right now, we had grown to
              have a reputation for supplying high-quality will fit Liners to
              suit each application.
            </p>
            <p>
              A mill lining is a customized wear part. Identifying the
              appropriate type of lining and design is vital for optimizing mill
              throughput and total grinding costs, including costs for energy,
              grinding media, and maintenance. Furthermore, the design must be
              constantly optimized to meet your needs. We work closely with our
              customers and carefully follow their processes to make sure the
              lining we supply is always optimized for current operating
              conditions.

                  Durga Alloys manufactures grid liners and smaller mill
                  liners by manganese steel, which include Mn14 and Mn18 alloy
                  steel. The manganese mill liners great advantage is that it
                  works hardens under stress, yet the substrate remains tough
                  and can withstand extreme impact without fracture. Its primary
                  disadvantage is that it spreads with impact, so solid liners
                  begin to squeeze together and become extremely difficult to
                  remove, and can damage a mill shell if the stress is allowed
                  to build up to an extreme level.

                  Durga Alloys manufactures AG mill liners, SAG mill liners,
                  and ball mill liners by chrome-moly steel (It is called L2B
                  and L2C grade in Australia standard). This material has
                  excellent wear characteristics with some impact resistance,
                  generally now used for discharge grates where slightly better
                  impact resistance is required compared to the other steels or
                  for thinner section liners. There is ongoing development
                  within this area as the size of the liners is outstripping the
                  properties provided by the standard high chrome-moly steels.
