            <h4>Shredder Grates By Durga Alloys</h4>
            <p>
              Shredder grates are the most important shredder wear parts. The
              grates ensure that shredded metal does not leave the shredding
              zone (hammermill) until shredded metal pieces are reduced to the
              desired size. The characteristics of the grate’s openings are
              determined by shredded-metal specifications and operating
              parameters. The grates sustain substantial abrasion and impacts
              from the rapidly moving metal inside the hammermill.
            </p>
            <p>

              Durga Alloys® premium manganese steel that has been developed from
              the original Hadfield’s manganese steel specification, our
              variation can provide unequaled toughness with excellent
              resistance to abrasion, which improves as the steelwork hardens in
              operation. Available in our M14, M18, and M21 material grades we
              have a cost-effective solution to your specific requirements.

              On the other hand, Durga Alloys’s engineers have researched some
              patent material to improve crusher wear parts span life. Such as,
              TIC inserts wear parts in crushing hard stone (1.5-3 times than
              manganese steel); Mircoalloy steel wear parts in crushing copper
              mine(1.5-2 times than manganese steel); Alloy steel wear parts in
              mineral separation…
