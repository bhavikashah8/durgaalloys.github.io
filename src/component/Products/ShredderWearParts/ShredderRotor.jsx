            <h4>Shredder Rotor Caps And End Disc Caps By Durga Alloys</h4>
            <p>
              Durga Alloys offers a full range of spare parts for metal or ELV
              shredding. We can produce high-performance rotor caps, end disc
              caps for our customers. In some cases, Durga Alloys has
              developed a type of unique designed shredder wear parts which can
              extend the wear life, while allowing crushers to achieve the best
              production capacity.
            </p>
            <p>
              Durga Alloys provides alloy steel and manganese steel spare
              parts from 10kg to 5000 kg for a metal scrap shredder machine.
              Whether we provide traditional high-manganese steel, high strength
              alloy steel spare parts, and 30CrNiMo alloy steel, Durga Alloys
              is committed to reducing wear parts costs per ton of crushed
              material for our customers. Importantly, through reasonable
              designing. Regarding other wear parts for scrap shredder machine,
              such as grates, liners, we have our own special design that
              drastically reduces the consumption of wear parts per ton of
              crushed materials and increase shredder throughput. Our end disc
              cap’s patented design offers maximum coverage and protection. Cast
              from a specially formulated hardened alloy and secured by high
              strength pins, Our Products end disc caps significantly improve
              the life expectancy of the rotor’s end discs.

              On the other hand, Durga Alloys’s engineers have researched some
              patent material to improve crusher wear parts span life. Such as,
              TIC inserts wear parts in crushing hard stone (1.5-3 times than
              manganese steel); Mircoalloy steel wear parts in crushing copper
              mine(1.5-2 times than manganese steel); Alloy steel wear parts in
              mineral separation…
