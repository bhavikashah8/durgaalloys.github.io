            <h4>Shredder Hammers By Durga Alloys</h4>
            <p>
              Shredders are widely used in metal scrap recycling. The Shredder
              device includes hammers joined to a massive rotor. Hammers are
              responsible for grinding, therefore, play a key role in the
              shredder. Most of the casted hammers are made from austenitic
              manganese steel.
            </p>
            <p>
              We have engineered a metal alloy that is optimized for metal
              shredding. Combined with rigorous lean manufacturing processes at
              our foundries, Durga Alloys has brought to the market a shredder
              hammer line that provides the lowest cost-per-ton for our
              customers. Our Shredder hammers are made in proprietary manganese
              steel, alloy steel, and TIC Inserts hammers. We also make
              different materials to suit different work conditionals, which is
              extremely hard on the bottom and possesses a softer material
              around the pin to keep the pin from wearing out. In essence, we
              are able to right-size the metallurgy of the casting to the
              particular application, resulting in the most wear-resistant part
              available.

              Durga Alloys® premium manganese steel that has been developed from
              the original Hadfield’s manganese steel specification, our
              variation can provide unequaled toughness with excellent
              resistance to abrasion, which improves as the steelwork hardens in
              operation. Available in our M14, M18, and M21 material grades we
              have a cost-effective solution to your specific requirements.

              On the other hand, Durga Alloys’s engineers have researched some
              patent material to improve crusher wear parts span life. Such as,
              TIC inserts wear parts in crushing hard stone (1.5-3 times than
              manganese steel); Mircoalloy steel wear parts in crushing copper
              mine(1.5-2 times than manganese steel); Alloy steel wear parts in
              mineral separation…
