            <h4>Manganese Steel Casting Foundry-Durga Alloys</h4>
            <p>
            Durga Alloys is one of the largest manganese steel casting
              foundries in the China market, which focuses on casting Hadfield
              steel for crusher liners, mill liners, shredder wear liners, and
              apron feeder flights. Currently, our company is capable of
              designing, engineering, and manufacturing castings ranging
              anywhere from 5 kgs to 18000 kgs in weight.
            </p>
            <p>
              Not only standard Hadfield steel (Mn14),Durga Alloys also cast
              super manganese steel (Mn18, Mn22) and manganese alloy steel
              (Mn14Cr2, Mn18Cr2, Mn22Cr2, Mn18Cr2NiMo, and other alloys) for
              mining, cement, and quarrying industry.

              </p>
              <p>
                Each process of our production is executed in strict accordance
                with the Standard Operation Procedure (SOP). The main process is
                as the following: Pouring simulation, Mold development, Raw
                material inspection, Modeling (Core-Making), Melting, Metal
                pouring, Cleaning and Heat treatment, Machining, Inspection,
                Warehouse packaging, and Shipping.
              </p>
              <p>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    Mold development. Design and produce molds according to the
                    requirements of the drawings. Generally, wood molds can be
                    used for single-piece production, plastic molds and metal
                    molds are made for mass production, and templates can be
                    made for mass castings.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Modeling (Core-Making). Includes modeling (forming the
                    cavity of the casting with molding sand), core-making
                    (forming the inner shape of the casting), and mold matching
                    (putting the core into the cavity and closing the upper and
                    lower flasks). Modeling is a key process in casting.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Melting. According to the required metal composition, the
                    chemical composition is matched, and the appropriate melting
                    furnace is selected to melt the alloy material to form a
                    qualified liquid metal liquid (including qualified
                    composition and qualified temperature).
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Metal Pouring. Pour qualified molten metal into the sandbox
                    equipped with the mold. The pouring stage has high safety
                    requirements, and we have rigorous process control to
                    protect the safety of our employees.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Clean and Heat treatment. After the molten metal is poured
                    and solidified, the molding sand is removed, and the gate
                    and other attachments are knocked out to form the required
                    casting.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Machining. Machining is the most important step to help the
                    goods to install.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Inspection. All blank dimensions are checked using a CMM. We
                    have the Rockwell hardness machine, dynamic balance
                    instrument, roundness meter, etc. The company’s quality
                    department has certified employees to do UT, PT, MT testing.
